# PR 2: Gallery Controls & Enhanced Navigation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**
Add interactive gallery controls and enhanced navigation features to provide user control over the viewing experience.

## ðŸ“‹ **Description**
Implement column controls, hover zoom, advanced keyboard shortcuts, and improved navigation to give users fine-grained control over their gallery viewing experience.

## âœ… **Tasks**
- [ ] Add column slider control (2-10 columns) with real-time updates
- [ ] Implement hover zoom functionality (100-200% scale, 1-second activation)
- [ ] Add scroll wheel navigation in fullscreen mode
- [ ] Implement advanced keyboard shortcuts (HJKL navigation, Space/Shift+Space)
- [ ] Add mouse gesture support for navigation
- [ ] Create smooth transitions for control changes
- [ ] Update UI to accommodate new controls

## ðŸ§ª **Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… **Controls**: Column slider (2-10) and hover zoom slider (100-200%) update instantly
- âœ… **Interaction**: Hover zoom activates after 1 second with smooth scaling
- âœ… **Navigation**: Scroll wheel changes images in fullscreen
- âœ… **Keyboard**: HJKL keys work for navigation, Space/Shift+Space for next/previous
- âœ… **Gestures**: Basic mouse drag gestures for navigation
- âœ… **Performance**: Controls remain responsive during image loading

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Notes**
- Column controls dynamically adjust CSS grid columns
- Hover zoom uses CSS transforms for smooth scaling
- Keyboard shortcuts avoid conflicts with browser defaults
- Mouse gestures use pointer events for smooth interaction
- All controls update gallery layout in real-time

## ðŸ“Š **Dependencies**
- PR 1: Core gallery functionality
- CSS grid system for responsive layout
- Event handling system

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Adjust column slider and verify grid updates instantly
- [ ] Hover over images and confirm zoom activates after 1 second
- [ ] Test HJKL navigation keys
- [ ] Use Space/Shift+Space for next/previous navigation
- [ ] Test scroll wheel in fullscreen mode
- [ ] Verify mouse gesture navigation
- [ ] Test control responsiveness with loaded images

## ðŸ“ˆ **Success Metrics**
- All controls update within 16ms (60fps)
- Smooth zoom transitions without jank
- Keyboard shortcuts work reliably
- No performance impact from controls
