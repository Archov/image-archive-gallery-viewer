# PR 4: Advanced Performance & Memory Management

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**
Implement sophisticated performance optimizations and memory management for handling large image collections.

## ðŸ“‹ **Description**
Upgrade from basic lazy loading to intelligent memory management that maintains optimal performance with thousands of images, providing desktop-class gallery performance.

## âœ… **Tasks**
- [ ] Implement intelligent lazy loading (100-300 images in memory)
- [ ] Add predictive preloading based on scroll direction
- [ ] Optimize image rendering and scaling performance
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for 1000+ images
- [ ] Add memory monitoring and automatic cleanup
- [ ] Create background processing for image operations
- [ ] Optimize database queries for large collections
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and diagnostics

## ðŸ§ª **Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… **Performance**: Gallery handles 1000+ images with instant loading (<1s initial)
- âœ… **Memory**: Maintains 100-300 images in memory based on viewport
- âœ… **Scrolling**: Smooth 60fps scrolling through large collections
- âœ… **Loading**: Invisible lazy loading except at extreme scroll speeds
- âœ… **Optimization**: Virtual scrolling prevents DOM bloat
- âœ… **Monitoring**: Memory usage stays under 500MB

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Notes**
- Implement sophisticated lazy loading algorithm
- Use Intersection Observer for viewport detection
- Add predictive loading based on scroll velocity/direction
- Create virtual scrolling to limit DOM elements
- Implement memory pressure monitoring
- Optimize image decoding and rendering pipeline
- Add background cleanup of unused resources

## ðŸ“Š **Dependencies**
- PR 1: Basic gallery functionality
- Database service with query optimization
- File system utilities for cleanup
- Performance monitoring APIs

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Test with 1000+ images for performance
- [ ] Verify memory usage stays within limits
- [ ] Test rapid scrolling - loading should be invisible
- [ ] Check virtual scrolling with large collections
- [ ] Monitor predictive loading accuracy
- [ ] Test memory cleanup under pressure
- [ ] Verify 60fps scrolling maintained

## ðŸ“ˆ **Success Metrics**
- Handles 10,000+ images smoothly
- Memory usage <500MB with large collections
- 60fps scrolling at all times
- Invisible loading transitions
- No performance degradation over time
- Desktop-class gallery performance
