# PR 1: Image File Management & Interactive Gallery

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**
Implement core image file handling and sophisticated gallery display with controls, inspired by example-gallery.js userscript behavior.

## ðŸ“‹ **Description**
Create a fully interactive gallery with column controls, hover zoom, fullscreen viewing, and keyboard navigation. Include basic image loading from local files for testing purposes.

## âœ… **Tasks**
- [ ] Create image service for file operations (load from local files)
- [ ] Implement thumbnail generation using Sharp (max 400px, maintain aspect ratio)
- [ ] Set up organized file structure (images/, thumbnails/, temp/)
- [ ] Build gallery UI with column slider (2-10 columns)
- [ ] Add hover zoom functionality with configurable scale (100-200%)
- [ ] Implement fullscreen image viewing with navigation
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation (arrow keys, escape, scroll wheel)
- [ ] Create image fallback handling for corrupted files
- [ ] Add basic drag-and-drop file loading for testing

## ðŸ§ª **Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… **UI**: Gallery displays images in responsive grid with column controls (2-10)
- âœ… **Controls**: Column slider and hover zoom slider (100-200%) update instantly
- âœ… **Interaction**: Hover zoom activates after 1 second with smooth scaling
- âœ… **Navigation**: Arrow keys navigate, scroll wheel changes images in fullscreen
- âœ… **Fullscreen**: Click image opens fullscreen with prev/next controls
- âœ… **Files**: Images load from drag-and-drop or file selection
- âœ… **Thumbnails**: Auto-generated thumbnails (max 400px, maintain aspect ratio) cached locally
- âœ… **Aspect Ratio**: All images display in native aspect ratio (thumbnails and fullscreen)
- âœ… **Performance**: Gallery handles 1000 images smoothly (<2s load, 60fps scrolling)

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Notes**
- Mirror example-gallery.js behavior exactly (columns, zoom, fullscreen, navigation)
- Use Sharp for thumbnail generation with aspect ratio preservation (max 400px on longest side)
- Implement lazy loading for performance with 1000+ images
- Add image caching to avoid regenerating thumbnails
- Handle various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
- Include fallback display for corrupted/unloadable images
- Gallery grid must accommodate varying aspect ratios naturally

## ðŸ“Š **Dependencies**
- Sharp package (already installed)
- Database schema for basic image storage
- File system utilities with async operations
- Basic UI framework (existing CSS foundation)

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Drag and drop image files onto gallery area
- [ ] Adjust column slider (2-8) and verify grid updates
- [ ] Adjust zoom slider and hover over images to test scaling
- [ ] Click images to enter fullscreen mode
- [ ] Use arrow keys to navigate in fullscreen
- [ ] Use scroll wheel to change images in fullscreen
- [ ] Test with 1000 images (performance check)
- [ ] Verify error handling for corrupted files
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts (Escape to exit fullscreen)

## ðŸ“ˆ **Success Metrics**
- Gallery loads 1000 images in <2 seconds
- Thumbnail generation <500ms per image (aspect ratio preserved)
- 60fps smooth scrolling and hover effects
- Zero crashes on corrupted images
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Memory usage <500MB with 1000 images
- Visual appeal with natural aspect ratios maintained
