# PR 1: Full-Quality Image Gallery & Interactive Controls

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**
Implement a pristine, full-quality image gallery with sophisticated interactive controls. Display images at maximum quality - no compression or thumbnails. Inspired by example-gallery.js behavior.

## ðŸ“‹ **Description**
Create a premium image viewing experience with column controls, hover zoom, fullscreen viewing, and keyboard navigation. Images are displayed at full quality with smart scaling to fit the layout while maintaining aspect ratios.

## âœ… **Tasks**
- [ ] Create image service for loading full-quality images from local files
- [ ] Implement smart image scaling (fit to column width, maintain aspect ratio)
- [ ] Set up organized file structure (images/, temp/)
- [ ] Build gallery UI with column slider (2-10 columns)
- [ ] Add hover zoom functionality with configurable scale (100-200%)
- [ ] Implement fullscreen image viewing with navigation
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation (arrow keys, escape, scroll wheel)
- [ ] Create image fallback handling for corrupted files
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop file loading for immediate gallery viewing
- [ ] Implement immersive fullscreen mode with auto-hiding controls
- [ ] Add minimal UI that fades during viewing (distraction-free)
- [ ] Create smooth image transitions and loading states
- [ ] Add image information overlay (dimensions, file size, format)
- [ ] Implement advanced keyboard shortcuts (HJKL navigation, etc.)
- [ ] Add mouse gesture support (drag to navigate, etc.)

## ðŸ§ª **Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… **UI**: Gallery displays full-quality images in responsive grid with column controls (2-10)
- âœ… **Controls**: Column slider and hover zoom slider (100-200%) update instantly
- âœ… **Interaction**: Hover zoom activates after 1 second with smooth scaling
- âœ… **Navigation**: Arrow keys navigate, scroll wheel changes images in fullscreen
- âœ… **Fullscreen**: Click image opens immersive fullscreen with auto-hiding controls
- âœ… **Distraction-Free**: UI fades away during viewing, reappears on mouse movement
- âœ… **Information**: Press 'I' to show/hide image info overlay (dimensions, size, format)
- âœ… **Gestures**: Drag horizontally to navigate images, mouse wheel for zoom
- âœ… **Keyboard**: HJKL for navigation, Space for next, Shift+Space for previous
- âœ… **Files**: Images load from drag-and-drop or file selection
- âœ… **Quality**: Images display at full quality with smart scaling to fit columns
- âœ… **Aspect Ratio**: All images display in native aspect ratio with proper scaling
- âœ… **Performance**: Gallery handles 1000+ images with instant loading (<1s initial, 60fps scrolling)

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Notes**
- Mirror example-gallery.js behavior exactly (columns, zoom, fullscreen, navigation)
- Use smart scaling: fit images to column width while maintaining aspect ratio
- Implement intelligent lazy loading: maintain +/- 3 pages in memory (minimum 100 images)
- Automatic load/unload based on scroll position and direction prediction
- Preload ahead of scroll direction for seamless experience
- Memory management: unload distant images, keep viewport and nearby images loaded
- Load images at display size for optimal performance and memory usage
- Implement distraction-free UI with auto-hiding controls and fade transitions
- Add smooth image transitions and loading states for polished experience
- Include image information overlay with metadata display
- Implement advanced keyboard shortcuts (HJKL navigation, etc.)
- Add mouse gesture support for intuitive navigation
- Handle various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
- Include fallback display for corrupted/unloadable images
- Gallery grid must accommodate varying aspect ratios naturally
- No compression or thumbnails - pristine image quality is priority

## ðŸ“Š **Dependencies**
- Sharp package (already installed) - for smart scaling
- Database schema for basic image storage
- File system utilities with async operations
- Basic UI framework (existing CSS foundation)

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Drag and drop image files onto gallery area
- [ ] Verify images display at full quality with proper scaling
- [ ] Adjust column slider (2-10) and verify grid updates
- [ ] Adjust zoom slider and hover over images to test scaling
- [ ] Click images to enter fullscreen mode
- [ ] Test auto-hiding controls in fullscreen (fade after inactivity)
- [ ] Use arrow keys to navigate in fullscreen
- [ ] Use HJKL keys for navigation
- [ ] Use Space/Shift+Space for next/previous
- [ ] Press 'I' to show/hide image information overlay
- [ ] Test mouse drag gestures for navigation
- [ ] Test mouse wheel for zoom in fullscreen
- [ ] Test UI fade behavior (controls disappear during viewing)
- [ ] Use scroll wheel to change images in fullscreen
- [ ] Test with 1000+ images (performance check)
- [ ] Verify intelligent lazy loading (100-300 images in memory)
- [ ] Test rapid scrolling - loading should be seamless
- [ ] Monitor memory usage stays under 500MB
- [ ] Verify error handling for corrupted files
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts (Escape to exit fullscreen)
- [ ] Confirm no compression artifacts in displayed images
- [ ] Test loading/unloading by scrolling back and forth

## ðŸ“ˆ **Success Metrics**
- Gallery initial load <1 second (loads first 100 images instantly)
- Seamless scrolling through 1000+ images with zero loading pauses
- Intelligent loading: maintains 100-300 images in memory based on viewport
- Distraction-free experience: UI fades away, controls auto-hide
- Smooth transitions: 60fps animations and hover effects
- Advanced navigation: HJKL keys, mouse gestures, Space navigation
- Memory usage <500MB with 1000+ images loaded
- Image scaling/rendering <50ms per image
- Zero crashes on corrupted images
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Pristine image quality with no compression artifacts
- Perfect aspect ratio preservation
- Lazy loading invisible except at extreme scroll speeds
- Immersive viewing: Controls disappear, images take center stage
