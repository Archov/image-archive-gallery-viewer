# PR 1: Image File Management & Interactive Gallery

## 🎯 **Overview**
Implement core image file handling and sophisticated gallery display with controls, inspired by example-gallery.js userscript behavior.

## 📋 **Description**
Create a fully interactive gallery with column controls, hover zoom, fullscreen viewing, and keyboard navigation. Include basic image loading from local files for testing purposes.

## ✅ **Tasks**
- [ ] Create image service for file operations (load from local files)
- [ ] Implement thumbnail generation using Sharp (200x200px)
- [ ] Set up organized file structure (images/, thumbnails/, temp/)
- [ ] Build gallery UI with column slider (2-8 columns)
- [ ] Add hover zoom functionality with configurable scale (100-200%)
- [ ] Implement fullscreen image viewing with navigation
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation (arrow keys, escape, scroll wheel)
- [ ] Create image fallback handling for corrupted files
- [ ] Add basic drag-and-drop file loading for testing

## 🧪 **Acceptance Criteria**
- ✅ **UI**: Gallery displays images in responsive grid with column controls (2-8)
- ✅ **Controls**: Column slider and hover zoom slider (100-200%) update instantly
- ✅ **Interaction**: Hover zoom activates after 1 second with smooth scaling
- ✅ **Navigation**: Arrow keys navigate, scroll wheel changes images in fullscreen
- ✅ **Fullscreen**: Click image opens fullscreen with prev/next controls
- ✅ **Files**: Images load from drag-and-drop or file selection
- ✅ **Thumbnails**: Auto-generated 200x200 thumbnails cached locally
- ✅ **Performance**: Gallery handles 1000 images smoothly (<2s load, 60fps scrolling)

## 🔧 **Technical Notes**
- Mirror example-gallery.js behavior exactly (columns, zoom, fullscreen, navigation)
- Use Sharp for thumbnail generation with proper error handling
- Implement lazy loading for performance with 1000+ images
- Add image caching to avoid regenerating thumbnails
- Handle various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
- Include fallback display for corrupted/unloadable images

## 📊 **Dependencies**
- Sharp package (already installed)
- Database schema for basic image storage
- File system utilities with async operations
- Basic UI framework (existing CSS foundation)

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Drag and drop image files onto gallery area
- [ ] Adjust column slider (2-8) and verify grid updates
- [ ] Adjust zoom slider and hover over images to test scaling
- [ ] Click images to enter fullscreen mode
- [ ] Use arrow keys to navigate in fullscreen
- [ ] Use scroll wheel to change images in fullscreen
- [ ] Test with 1000 images (performance check)
- [ ] Verify error handling for corrupted files
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts (Escape to exit fullscreen)

## 📈 **Success Metrics**
- Gallery loads 1000 images in <2 seconds
- Thumbnail generation <200ms per image
- 60fps smooth scrolling and hover effects
- Zero crashes on corrupted images
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Memory usage <500MB with 1000 images
