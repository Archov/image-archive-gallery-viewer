## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**
Implement distraction-free UI with auto-hiding controls and immersive viewing experience.

## ðŸ“‹ **Description**
Create a professional, distraction-free interface where controls automatically hide during viewing and reappear based on user proximity, providing an immersive image viewing experience.

## âœ… **Tasks**
- [ ] Implement auto-hiding controls (3-second inactivity timeout)
- [ ] Add proximity-based control visibility (mouse near edges)
- [ ] Create smooth fade transitions for UI elements
- [ ] Add image information overlay (dimensions, file size, format)
- [ ] Implement toggle for information overlay ('I' key)
- [ ] Create immersive fullscreen mode with enhanced controls
- [ ] Add loading states and smooth image transitions
- [ ] Optimize UI for distraction-free viewing

## ðŸ§ª **Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… **Distraction-Free**: UI fades after 3s inactivity, reappears on edge proximity
- âœ… **Information**: Press 'I' to show/hide image info overlay
- âœ… **Fullscreen**: Enhanced fullscreen with auto-hiding controls
- âœ… **Transitions**: Smooth fade in/out animations for all UI elements
- âœ… **Loading**: Elegant loading states for image transitions
- âœ… **Immersive**: Images take center stage with minimal UI interference

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Notes**
- Use CSS transitions for smooth fade effects
- Implement mouse proximity detection with edge zones
- Create information overlay with metadata display
- Add activity timers for auto-hiding controls
- Optimize for both windowed and fullscreen modes
- Ensure accessibility with keyboard alternatives

## ðŸ“Š **Dependencies**

- [ ] Press 'I' key to toggle information overlay
- [ ] Check fullscreen enhanced mode
- [ ] Test smooth fade transitions
- [ ] Verify loading states during navigation
- [ ] Test distraction-free scrolling experience

## ðŸ“ˆ **Success Metrics**
