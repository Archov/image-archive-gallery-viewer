# Work Item Task Files

This directory contains individual Work Item (WI) task definitions for the Image Gallery Management System development.

## üìã **File Structure**

Each WI file follows the format: `WI-XX-description.md`

- **WI Number**: Sequential numbering (01-17 for all planned features)
- **Description**: Brief, descriptive title
- **Content**: Complete task specification

## üéØ **How to Use**

When assigning work to an AI agent or developer:

1. **Reference the specific WI file**: "Please implement the tasks in `Work-Items/WI-01-image-file-management.md`"
2. **Include context**: "This is part of the Image Gallery Management System"
3. **Specify priority**: "This is the first WI in the development sequence"

## üìä **WI Content Structure**

Each WI file contains:

- **Overview**: High-level description
- **Description**: Detailed explanation
- **Tasks**: Specific implementation checklist
- **Acceptance Criteria**: What success looks like
- **Technical Notes**: Implementation guidance
- **Dependencies**: What must be completed first
- **Testing Checklist**: How to verify completion
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes

## ‚úÖ **Completion Criteria**

A WI is complete when:
- All tasks are checked off
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Testing checklist passes
- Success metrics are achieved
- Code is reviewed and approved

## üîÑ **Updates**

When WI specifications change:
1. Update the corresponding WI file
2. Update dependencies in affected WIs
3. Communicate changes to team members
