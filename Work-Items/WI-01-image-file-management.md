# PR 1: Core Full-Quality Image Gallery

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**
Implement the foundation of a pristine, full-quality image gallery. Focus on core image loading, display, and basic navigation without advanced UI features.

## ðŸ“‹ **Description**
Create the basic gallery infrastructure that loads and displays full-quality images with smart scaling, maintaining aspect ratios. Include essential navigation and file loading capabilities.

## âœ… **Tasks**
- [ ] Create image service for loading full-quality images from local files
- [ ] Implement smart image scaling (fit to column width, maintain aspect ratio)
- [ ] Set up organized file structure (images/, temp/)
- [ ] Build basic gallery grid layout (fixed columns, no controls yet)
- [ ] Implement fullscreen image viewing with basic navigation
- [ ] Add basic keyboard navigation (arrow keys, escape)
- [ ] Create image fallback handling for corrupted files
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop file loading for immediate gallery viewing

## ðŸ§ª **Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… **UI**: Gallery displays full-quality images in basic grid layout
- âœ… **Files**: Images load from drag-and-drop or file selection
- âœ… **Quality**: Images display at full quality with smart scaling to fit columns
- âœ… **Aspect Ratio**: All images display in native aspect ratio with proper scaling
- âœ… **Navigation**: Arrow keys and escape work for basic navigation
- âœ… **Fullscreen**: Click image opens fullscreen with prev/next controls
- âœ… **Performance**: Gallery handles 100+ images with reasonable loading times
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Clear display for corrupted/unloadable images

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Notes**
- Focus on core image loading and display functionality
- Use smart scaling: fit images to column width while maintaining aspect ratio
- Basic lazy loading: load images as they come into view (simplified version)
- Load images at display size for optimal performance
- Handle various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
- Include fallback display for corrupted/unloadable images
- Basic grid layout accommodates varying aspect ratios
- No compression or thumbnails - pristine image quality is priority
- Keep scope minimal for fast iteration and testing

## ðŸ“Š **Dependencies**
- Sharp package (already installed) - for smart scaling
- Database schema for basic image storage
- File system utilities with async operations
- Basic UI framework (existing CSS foundation)

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Drag and drop image files onto gallery area
- [ ] Verify images display at full quality with proper scaling
- [ ] Confirm aspect ratios are maintained (no distortion)
- [ ] Click images to enter fullscreen mode
- [ ] Use arrow keys to navigate in fullscreen
- [ ] Use escape to exit fullscreen
- [ ] Test with 100+ images (performance check)
- [ ] Verify basic lazy loading works
- [ ] Verify error handling for corrupted files
- [ ] Confirm no compression artifacts in displayed images

## ðŸ“ˆ **Success Metrics**
- Gallery initial load <2 seconds (loads images as they come into view)
- Basic lazy loading works without blocking UI
- Memory usage reasonable for 100+ images
- Image scaling/rendering <100ms per image
- Zero crashes on corrupted images
- Basic keyboard navigation works reliably
- Pristine image quality with no compression artifacts
- Perfect aspect ratio preservation
- Clean, functional gallery interface
